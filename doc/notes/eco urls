New ecolocal user paths
---------------------------------

1. Home Page			Static page with a search box and a couple of links.

					2.	User enters name of town and 'searches'
					3.	User clicks on one of the three main section links for Home, Health, Family

2. Search results		Lists all matching results for the user search from the home page.
					
					4.	If there is only one result, take the user straight the overview page.

					5.	If there are no results, user is asked to create this page

3. Global sections		Lists everything relevant to each section - Home, Health, Family.
					Articles sorted by popularity and recency. Users can page through them.

4. Overview page		Provides an overview to the area page, listing the top Home, Health and Family articles.

5. Create page			User can create a page that is missing on ecolocal

					Required fields and how they are used:

					- Name (non-editable), is used to create the place name and in the url

					- County (chosen from a drop down or checkboxes). Used to connect the place to a county,
					  which is also used to create the aggregated county pages that work like digg.com

					- Description. A brief description about this new page.

					All three fields are used by the home page search engine to find relevant content when a user 					searches.

Ideas
-----
  * Create groups to discuss eco issues vs. create groups to discuss local issues.
  * The digg style of aggregated local content vs. the digg style of aggregated topical content
  * The user who wants to talk about Dartford vs. the user who wants to talk about ecofriendly insulation.
