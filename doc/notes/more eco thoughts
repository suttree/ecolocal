The whole thing is a wiki - place a layer of abstratcion over the top where new content 
is fact checked by us. Then is placed onto the site for rating. The sections act
like tags too.

Look into local government stats to fill the site with data.
Tie into theyworkforyou and pledgebank for more links, stats and data.

A bit like kelkoo and a bit like moneysupermarket, but for health/finance/etc

Then add in buddy lists, build up a trust network a la ebay, bring in jobs and dating.

FREE CLASSIFIEDS TO BUILD THE COMMUNITY, FREE TRADE TO SELL SKILLS - way to upload images and details about each skill/product

HOSTING FOR YOUR OWN WEBPAGES - to display more images (about you, your skills, your house, your kids) etc

web 2.0 needs data 2.0. data 2.0 needs metadata 2.0 - e.g. guess what type of tags, also how did i get here - save your navigation history along with your tags

Another website idea - joined up travel information. Plug in location and destination and website figures out way between the two.
So it can find out how to get from airport A to airport B, especially useful when you can't go direct. Gives you all the choices
and links to find out the prices (or screen scrapes prices too). Can do the same for train/tube combinations, or ferry/train...

== Green Social Website ==

=== Home page ===

  * Option of one bit search box (a la Google or Upmystreet)
  * Or, choose one of the global categories - Home/Living, Health, Family

=== Section page ===

  * One of either Home/Living, Health, Family.

  * Each main section has many

=== Local section page ===

  * One of either Home/Living, Health, Family

==== Categories ====

  * Categories to fit into each section (local or global):

  * classifieds - etsy/craigslist
  * local history - photo's of the area
  * family history - genealogoy
  * special offers - for partners
  * out and about - parks, day trips, markets
  * home - green supplies, how-to's
  * health - gyms, shops
  * kids - nurseries, activies, nct
  * charity - charity shops, recycling depots

  * All categories should have full commenting abilities, tied to the local/global setting.
  * Comments can have +1/-1 ratings too, all of which adds to your user rating.

  * Each section and cateogry has RSS feeds attached and also mailing list capabilities, 'notify me when this page is updated'.

==== Users ====

  * Users can have blogs, about me and photo pages but only if they want it.
  * Users have to accept or ask for this, that way there are no empty member home pages.

  * Users will also go through a staggered registration process (although they can sign up fully if they want to), i.e.

__User types__

  * Browser - read only
  * Commentator - read/write. To post their first comment they have to give us a username and password
  * Receiver - read/write? Registers to accept email updates from the site, local or global specific.
  * Creator - write/read. Local business or gossip. Adds content to the site. Need full details.

__Town crier__

  * The site should contain information on a global and local scale, but it should also support groups, based around locations, interests or places/tags.

  * The ums mistake was enforcing strict postcode based separation.
  * To stop the disjointed groups, we won't separate by location.

  * e.g. Terry and Sheila could create a group for their estate, using the site to distribute news, details, photos and events.
  * e.g. The Collinsons could create a group for their family, taking in locations from Dartford, Newcastle and wherever else.

  * All groups can be RSS enabled, and also email enabled ('notify me when this page changes').

==== Site infrastructure ====

  * RoR
  * Site is a wiki, to allow addition of locations and groups
  * RESTful urls
