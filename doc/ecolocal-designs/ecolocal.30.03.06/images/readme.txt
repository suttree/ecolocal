Chameleon Web IconsBy SimpleBitshttp://simplebits.com/shop/icons/September 2005----------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for purchasing a Ready-Made Pack of Chameleon web icons from
SimpleBits!  We've created each icon using only the finest pixels 
available.  We hope you enjoy them. Because of their small size, and 
simplistic shapes, they are perhaps the most versatile icons one 
could own.Problems with the set?  Contact us with any questions you may have regarding Chameleon:http://simplebits.com/contact/
