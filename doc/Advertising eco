========================

Hello,

I'd like to bring your attention to a new website that is aimed at
giving people across the UK a place to talk about local issues.
Ecolocal has a strong 'green' ethic, with plenty of discussions about
keeping kids healthy, eating the right food, recycling and how to live
a more sustainable lifestyle.

http://ecolocal.co.uk

Ecolocal also has a comprehensive events calendar, which is a great
way for people to find out what's on in their local area over the
coming weeks.

I'd appreciate it if you could feature Ecolocal on your website as we
could use the exposure to help build the site into a really useful
resource.

Many thanks,

Duncan Gough
