#
# == Runt -- Ruby Temporal Expressions
#
# The usage and design patterns expressed in this library are mostly...*uhm*..
# <em>entirely</em>..*cough*...based on a series of
# <tt>articles</tt>[http://www.martinfowler.com] by Martin Fowler.
#
# It highly recommended that anyone using Runt (or writing
# object-oriented software :) take a moment to peruse the wealth of useful info
# that Fowler has made publicly available:
#
# * An excellent introductory summation of temporal <tt>patterns</tt>[http://martinfowler.com/ap2/timeNarrative.html]
# * Recurring event <tt>pattern</tt>[http://martinfowler.com/apsupp/recurring.pdf]
#
# Also, for those of you (like me, for example) still chained in your cubicle and forced
# to write <tt>Java</tt>[http://java.sun.com] code, check out the original version of
# project called <tt>ChronicJ</tt>[http://chronicj.org].
