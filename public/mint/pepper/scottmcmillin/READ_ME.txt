TO INSTALL:

Copy the scottmcmillin folder into your /mint/pepper/ directory.

If you already have a scottmcmillin directory (you are upgrading or have another of my peppers) then just copy the pies directory into the current scottmcmillin directory. It is probably a good idea to UNINSTALL Referrer Rollup prior to upgrading.
